### 2. Data Integration
✅ Integrated vendor/product information from export.json
✅ Converted detection methods to standardized pattern format
✅ Organized patterns by category (networking, web, database)
✅ Created 15 service detection patterns from export.json data

### 3. Data Organization
✅ Created structured vendor data (13 vendors)
✅ Created structured product data (17 products)
✅ Organized service patterns in category directories
✅ Maintained metadata for traceability

### 4. Community Enablement
✅ Created comprehensive contribution guidelines
✅ Established pattern validation framework
✅ Provided templates for new contributions
✅ Documented repository structure and usage

## Repository Contents
