## Introduction

The Version Detection Pattern Database is an open-source collection of regex patterns designed to help security researchers, penetration testers, and developers identify software versions through service banners, HTTP responses, and other network protocol responses.

Our database provides:
- Community-driven version detection patterns
- Structured regex pattern data in JSON format
- Machine-readable data for tool integration
- Open-source collaboration under MIT license
- Comprehensive test cases for pattern validation
