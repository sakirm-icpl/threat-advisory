## Verification

All links now explicitly point to the master branch of the repository, ensuring users will see the correct branch when they click on the links.

## Files Checked

The following files were checked and updated as needed:
1. docs/index.html
2. docs/pattern-database.html
3. docs/community/beginners-guide.html
4. docs/community/good-first-issues.html
5. docs/community/pattern-development.html

## Pattern Links Unchanged

The individual pattern links in the pattern database page were already correctly pointing to specific files in the master branch and did not require changes:
- Pattern links already use the format: `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/blob/master/patterns/category/file.json`
- Directory links already use the format: `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/tree/master/patterns`

These links correctly point to the master branch and specific files, so no changes were needed.
