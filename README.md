# Version Detection Pattern Database

An open-source repository of regex patterns for detecting software versions across different products and applications. This database is designed to support security scanning tools, penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, VAPT, and other security-related activities.

## Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive database of regex patterns that can identify software versions from various sources like HTTP headers, file contents, network responses, and more. By providing a centralized repository of well-tested patterns, we can help security professionals quickly identify software versions during assessments.

## Use Cases

- Security scanning tools
- Penetration testing
- Bug bounty hunting
- Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT)
- Asset discovery and management
- Threat intelligence
