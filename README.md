By providing a centralized repository of curated threat data, we can help security professionals stay ahead of emerging threats.

## Use Cases

- Threat intelligence platforms
- Vulnerability management systems
- Security operations centers (SOCs)
- Incident response teams
- Red team/blue team exercises
- Security research and analysis

## Advisory Format

Each advisory follows a standardized JSON structure for consistency and ease of processing:

```json
{
  "advisories": [
    {
      "id": "THREAT-2024-001",
      "title": "Advisory Title",
      "severity": "high",
      "category": "vulnerability",
      "affected_products": ["Product A", "Product B"],
      "description": "Detailed description of the threat or vulnerability",
      "impact": "Potential impact of the threat",
      "recommendations": ["Recommendation 1", "Recommendation 2"],
      "references": ["https://example.com/reference1", "https://example.com/reference2"],
      "published_date": "2024-01-01",
      "last_updated": "2024-01-01",
      "metadata": {
        "author": "Contributor Name",
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
        "cvss_score": 7.5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sample Advisories

We've included several sample advisories to demonstrate the format and capabilities:

- [CVE-2024-12345](advisories/cve/cve-2024-12345.json) - Critical vulnerability advisory
- [APT29 Campaign](advisories/apt/apt29-campaign.json) - APT group activity advisory
- [Ransomware Variant](advisories/malware/ransomware-variant.json) - Malware threat advisory
- [Authentication Bypass](advisories/vulnerability/webserver-pro-auth-bypass.json) - High severity vulnerability advisory
- [Supply Chain Risks](advisories/threat/supply-chain-risks.json) - Medium severity threat advisory

## Advisory Categories
