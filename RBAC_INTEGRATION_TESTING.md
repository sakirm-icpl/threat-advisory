# VersionIntel RBAC Integration Testing Documentation

## üß™ Overview

This document describes the comprehensive integration testing suite for VersionIntel's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. These tests verify that all components work together correctly, including GitHub OAuth integration, role-based access control, ownership enforcement, and audit logging.

## üéØ Testing Objectives

1. **Complete GitHub OAuth Flow**: Verify the full authentication process
2. **RBAC Enforcement**: Ensure role-based access control works end-to-end
3. **Ownership-Based Access**: Validate created_by field enforcement
4. **Admin Functionality**: Test user management and system administration
5. **Audit Trail**: Verify all actions are properly logged
6. **Security Compliance**: Ensure no privilege escalation is possible

## üß™ Integration Test Scenarios

### 1. Complete GitHub OAuth Flow Test

#### Test: `test_complete_github_oauth_flow`
**Objective**: Verify the GitHub OAuth endpoints are accessible and functional

**Steps**:
1. Call `/auth/github/login` endpoint
2. Verify response contains authorization URL or redirect
3. (Manual) Complete OAuth flow with real GitHub account

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ GitHub login endpoint returns 200 or 302 status
- ‚úÖ Authorization URL is properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Callback endpoint processes OAuth response

### 2. Admin User Lifecycle Test

#### Test: `test_admin_user_lifecycle`
**Objective**: Test the complete lifecycle of admin user management

**Steps**:
1. Create initial admin user
2. Login as admin
3. Create contributor user via admin endpoint
4. List users to verify both exist
5. Promote contributor to admin
6. Verify promotion in user list
7. Create another admin to avoid last admin error
8. Demote promoted user back to contributor

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Admin can create users with specific roles
- ‚úÖ User listing shows all users
- ‚úÖ User promotion works correctly
- ‚úÖ User demotion works correctly
- ‚úÖ Last admin protection prevents accidental lockout

### 3. RBAC Enforcement with Ownership Test

#### Test: `test_rbac_enforcement_with_created_by_field`
**Objective**: Verify RBAC rules with ownership-based access control

**Steps**:
1. Create admin and contributor users
2. Login as admin and create vendor
3. Login as contributor and attempt to modify admin's vendor
4. Contributor creates their own vendor
5. Contributor updates their own vendor
6. Admin updates contributor's vendor

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Contributor cannot modify admin's vendor (403 Forbidden)
- ‚úÖ Contributor can modify their own vendor (200 OK)
- ‚úÖ Admin can modify any vendor (200 OK)
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for unauthorized access

### 4. Audit Logging Integration Test

#### Test: `test_audit_logging_integration`
**Objective**: Verify audit logging captures all relevant actions

**Steps**:

2. Login as admin
3. Perform actions (create vendor, update product, etc.)
4. Check audit logs for recorded actions

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All admin actions are logged
- ‚úÖ Audit log contains user ID, action type, resource type
- ‚úÖ Audit log includes timestamp and request metadata
- ‚úÖ Audit log endpoint is accessible to admins

### 5. Role Change Audit Trail Test

#### Test: `test_role_change_audit_trail`
**Objective**: Verify role changes are properly tracked

**Steps**:
1. Create admin and contributor users
2. Login as admin
3. Promote contributor to admin
4. Check audit logs for role change

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Role promotion is logged in audit trail
- ‚úÖ Log entry contains old and new role information
- ‚úÖ Log entry includes admin user who performed the action
- ‚úÖ Log entry includes timestamp and reason

## üîß Manual Integration Testing Procedures

### GitHub OAuth Manual Testing

1. **Setup GitHub OAuth Application**:
   - Create OAuth app in GitHub Developer Settings
   - Set callback URL to `http://localhost:8000/auth/github/callback`
   - Update environment variables with client ID and secret

2. **Test OAuth Flow**:
   ```bash
   # Start the application
   cd backend
   python main.py
   
   # Visit in browser
   http://localhost:8000/auth/github/login
   
   # Complete GitHub authentication
   # Verify JWT token is returned
   ```

3. **Verify User Creation**:
   - Check database for new user record
   - Verify GitHub ID, username, and email are stored
   - Confirm default role is set to contributor

### Role-Based Access Manual Testing

1. **Admin Access Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Login as admin
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password"}'
   
   # Access admin endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/auth/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Contributor Access Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Login as contributor
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "contributor", "password": "password"}'
   
   # Attempt admin access (should fail)
   curl http://localhost:8000/auth/users \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CONTRIBUTOR_TOKEN"
   ```

3. **Ownership Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Contributor creates resource
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/vendors \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CONTRIBUTOR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Test Vendor", "description": "My vendor"}'
   
   # Contributor accesses their resource (should succeed)
   curl http://localhost:8000/vendors/1 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CONTRIBUTOR_TOKEN"
   
   # Another contributor accesses resource (should fail)
   curl http://localhost:8000/vendors/1 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ANOTHER_CONTRIBUTOR_TOKEN"
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Integration Testing

### Privilege Escalation Prevention

   - Verify operation is blocked with appropriate error

3. **Test Unauthorized Role Changes**:
   - Contributor attempts to promote themselves
   - Verify operation is blocked with 403 Forbidden

### Data Access Control

1. **Cross-User Data Access**:
   - Contributor attempts to access another user's data
   - Verify access is denied with appropriate error

2. **Admin Override Verification**:
   - Admin accesses any user's data
   - Verify access is granted

3. **Resource Ownership Enforcement**:
   - Contributor attempts to modify another user's resource
   - Verify modification is denied
