# Link Fix Summary

This document summarizes all the updates made to fix the linking issues in the Version Detection Pattern Database and configure it for your actual repository (sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory).

## Issues Fixed

1. **Pattern Database Links**: Added direct links to each pattern file in the pattern database page
2. **Repository Links**: Updated all references to point to your actual repository (sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory)
3. **Live Site Links**: Updated all references to point to your actual GitHub Pages site
4. **Navigation Links**: Ensured all internal navigation links work correctly

## Changes Made

### Pattern Database Page (`docs/pattern-database.html`)
- Added direct GitHub links to each pattern name, pointing to their actual JSON files
- Examples:
  - Apache HTTPD Server now links to `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/blob/master/patterns/web/apache.json`
  - MySQL now links to `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/blob/master/patterns/database/mysql.json`
  - And so on for all 27 patterns

### All HTML Documentation Pages
- Updated footer links to point to your repository:
  - GitHub Repository: `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory`
  - Live Site: `https://sakirm-icpl.github.io/threat-advisory/`
- Updated navigation links to work correctly

### Markdown Files
- README.md: Updated all links to point to your repository
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Updated all links to point to your repository
- patterns/CONTRIBUTING.md: Updated all links to point to your repository

### Configuration Files
- CNAME: Updated to `sakirm-icpl.github.io`
- sitemap.xml: Updated all URLs to point to `https://sakirm-icpl.github.io/threat-advisory/`
- robots.txt: Updated sitemap reference to point to `https://sakirm-icpl.github.io/threat-advisory/sitemap.xml`

## Verification

- All 27 patterns still pass validation
- All links now point to your actual repository
- Pattern names in the database are now clickable and link to their respective JSON files
- The site is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages

## Next Steps

To deploy this correctly:

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
3. Your site will be available at: https://sakirm-icpl.github.io/threat-advisory/
4. All pattern links will work correctly, taking users directly to the JSON files in your repository
