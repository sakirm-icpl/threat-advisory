# Final Link Verification

This document summarizes the final verification of all GitHub repository links to ensure they correctly point to the master branch.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Beginners Guide Page
- Fixed one link that was missing the `/tree/master` path:
  - Line 184 in `docs/community/beginners-guide.html`
  - From: `<a href="https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory">GitHub repository</a>`
  - To: `<a href="https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/tree/master">GitHub repository</a>`

## Verification Results

All links in the repository now correctly point to the master branch:

### HTML Files Verified
1. `docs/index.html` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master`
2. `docs/pattern-database.html` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master` or `/blob/master`
3. `docs/community/beginners-guide.html` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master` or `/blob/master`
4. `docs/community/good-first-issues.html` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master`
5. `docs/community/pattern-development.html` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master`

### Markdown Files Verified
1. `README.md` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master` or `/blob/master`
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - All links correctly point to `/tree/master` or `/blob/master`
3. `patterns/CONTRIBUTING.md` - No GitHub links found

### Pattern Links
All individual pattern links in `docs/pattern-database.html` correctly point to specific files using the format:
- `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/blob/master/patterns/category/file.json`

### Directory Links
All directory links correctly point to directories using the format:
- `https://github.com/sakirm-icpl/threat-advisory/tree/master/patterns`

## Summary

All GitHub repository links in the project now explicitly include the `/tree/master` path where appropriate, ensuring users will view the correct branch when they click on the links. The only exception is pattern and file links which correctly use `/blob/master` to point to specific files.

No further issues were found during the verification process.
